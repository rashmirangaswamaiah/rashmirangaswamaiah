			<p> <strong>Manchurian is an Indian Chinese fried cauliflower food item popular in India.
Gobi (Cauliflower) Manchurian is the result of the adaptation of Chinese cooking and seasoning techniques to suit Indian tastes. 
It is believed to have been originally developed by a small Chinese community which lived in Kolkata for a century. 
In its two-stage preparation, the first stage requires preparing a spiced corn flour batter, dipping cauliflower florets in it and deep frying them. 
In the second stage, the deep fried florets are saut√©ed with chopped onion, capsicum, garlic, etc. in soy and chili sauce.</strong> </p>
